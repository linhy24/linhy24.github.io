                <b>THE SONNETS</b><br>
                <i>William Shakespeare</i><br><br>
                From fairest creatures we desire increase,<br>
                That thereby beauty's rose might never die,<br>
                But as the riper should by time decease,<br>
                His tender heir might bear his memory:<br>
                But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,<br>
                Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,<br>
                Making a famine where abundance lies,<br>
                Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:<br>
                Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,<br>
                And only herald to the gaudy spring,<br>
                Within thine own bud buriest thy content,<br>
                And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:<br>
                Pity the world, or else this glutton be,<br>
                To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.<br>
                <br>
                When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,<br>
                And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,<br>
                Thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now,<br>
                Will be a tattered weed of small worth held: <br>
                Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,<br>
                Where all the treasure of thy lusty days;<br>
                To say within thine own deep sunken eyes,<br>
                Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.<br>
                How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use,<br>
                If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine<br>
                Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse'<br>
                Proving his beauty by succession thine.<br>
                This were to be new made when thou art old,<br>
                And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.<br>
                <br>
                Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest,<br>
                Now is the time that face should form another,<br>
                Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,<br>
                Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.<br>
                For where is she so fair whose uneared womb<br>
                Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?<br>
                Or who is he so fond will be the tomb,<br>
                Of his self-love to stop posterity? <br>
                Thou art thy mother's glass and she in thee<br>
                Calls back the lovely April of her prime,<br>
                So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,<br>
                Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.<br>
                But if thou live remembered not to be,<br>
                Die single and thine image dies with thee.<br>
                <br>
                Unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend,<br>
                Upon thy self thy beauty's legacy?<br>
                Nature's bequest gives nothing but doth lend,<br>
                And being frank she lends to those are free:<br>
                Then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse,<br>
                The bounteous largess given thee to give?<br>
                Profitless usurer why dost thou use<br>
                So great a sum of sums yet canst not live?<br>
                For having traffic with thy self alone,<br>
                Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive,<br>
                Then how when nature calls thee to be gone,<br>
                What acceptable audit canst thou leave? <br>
                Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,<br>
                Which used lives th' executor to be.<br>
                <br>
                Those hours that with gentle work did frame<br>
                The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell<br>
                Will play the tyrants to the very same,<br>
                And that unfair which fairly doth excel:<br>
                For never-resting time leads summer on<br>
                To hideous winter and confounds him there,<br>
                Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,<br>
                Beauty o'er-snowed and bareness every where:<br>
                Then were not summer's distillation left<br>
                A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,<br>
                Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,<br>
                Nor it nor no remembrance what it was.<br>
                But flowers distilled though they with winter meet,<br>
                Leese but their show, their substance still lives sweet.<br>
                <br>
                Then let not winter's ragged hand deface,<br>
                In thee thy summer ere thou be distilled:<br>
                Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place,<br>
                With beauty's treasure ere it be self-killed:<br>
                That use is not forbidden usury,<br>
                Which happies those that pay the willing loan;<br>
                That's for thy self to breed another thee,<br>
                Or ten times happier be it ten for one,<br>
                Ten times thy self were happier than thou art,<br>
                If ten of thine ten times refigured thee:<br>
                Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart,<br>
                Leaving thee living in posterity?<br>
                Be not self-willed for thou art much too fair,<br>
                To be death's conquest and make worms thine heir.<br>
                <br>
                Lo in the orient when the gracious light<br>
                Lifts up his burning head, each under eye<br>
                Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,<br>
                Serving with looks his sacred majesty, <br>
                And having climbed the steep-up heavenly hill,<br>
                Resembling strong youth in his middle age,<br>
                Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,<br>
                Attending on his golden pilgrimage:<br>
                But when from highmost pitch with weary car,<br>
                Like feeble age he reeleth from the day,<br>
                The eyes (fore duteous) now converted are<br>
                From his low tract and look another way:<br>
                So thou, thy self out-going in thy noon:<br>
                Unlooked on diest unless thou get a son.<br>
                <br>
                Music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly?<br>
                Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy:<br>
                Why lov'st thou that which thou receiv'st not gladly,<br>
                Or else receiv'st with pleasure thine annoy?<br>
                If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,<br>
                By unions married do offend thine ear,<br>
                They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds<br>
                In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear: <br>
                Mark how one string sweet husband to another,<br>
                Strikes each in each by mutual ordering;<br>
                Resembling sire, and child, and happy mother,<br>
                Who all in one, one pleasing note do sing:<br>
                Whose speechless song being many, seeming one,<br>
                Sings this to thee, 'Thou single wilt prove none'.<br>
                <br>
                Is it for fear to wet a widow's eye,<br>
                That thou consum'st thy self in single life?<br>
                Ah, if thou issueless shalt hap to die,<br>
                The world will wail thee like a makeless wife,<br>
                The world will be thy widow and still weep,<br>
                That thou no form of thee hast left behind,<br>
                When every private widow well may keep,<br>
                By children's eyes, her husband's shape in mind:<br>
                Look what an unthrift in the world doth spend<br>
                Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;<br>
                But beauty's waste hath in the world an end,<br>
                And kept unused the user so destroys it: <br>
                No love toward others in that bosom sits<br>
                That on himself such murd'rous shame commits.<br>
                <br>
                For shame deny that thou bear'st love to any<br>
                Who for thy self art so unprovident.<br>
                Grant if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,<br>
                But that thou none lov'st is most evident:<br>
                For thou art so possessed with murd'rous hate,<br>
                That 'gainst thy self thou stick'st not to conspire,<br>
                Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate<br>
                Which to repair should be thy chief desire:<br>
                O change thy thought, that I may change my mind,<br>
                Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love?<br>
                Be as thy presence is gracious and kind,<br>
                Or to thy self at least kind-hearted prove,<br>
                Make thee another self for love of me,<br>
                That beauty still may live in thine or thee.<br>
                <br>
                As fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou grow'st,<br>
                In one of thine, from that which thou departest,<br>
                And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow'st,<br>
                Thou mayst call thine, when thou from youth convertest,<br>
                Herein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase,<br>
                Without this folly, age, and cold decay,<br>
                If all were minded so, the times should cease,<br>
                And threescore year would make the world away:<br>
                Let those whom nature hath not made for store,<br>
                Harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish:<br>
                Look whom she best endowed, she gave thee more;<br>
                Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:<br>
                She carved thee for her seal, and meant thereby,<br>
                Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.<br>
                <br>
                When I do count the clock that tells the time,<br>
                And see the brave day sunk in hideous night,<br>
                When I behold the violet past prime,<br>
                And sable curls all silvered o'er with white: <br>
                When lofty trees I see barren of leaves,<br>
                Which erst from heat did canopy the herd<br>
                And summer's green all girded up in sheaves<br>
                Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard:<br>
                Then of thy beauty do I question make<br>
                That thou among the wastes of time must go,<br>
                Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake,<br>
                And die as fast as they see others grow,<br>
                And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence<br>
                Save breed to brave him, when he takes thee hence.<br>
                <br>
                O that you were your self, but love you are<br>
                No longer yours, than you your self here live,<br>
                Against this coming end you should prepare,<br>
                And your sweet semblance to some other give.<br>
                So should that beauty which you hold in lease<br>
                Find no determination, then you were<br>
                Your self again after your self's decease,<br>
                When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear. <br>
                Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,<br>
                Which husbandry in honour might uphold,<br>
                Against the stormy gusts of winter's day<br>
                And barren rage of death's eternal cold?<br>
                O none but unthrifts, dear my love you know,<br>
                You had a father, let your son say so.<br>
                <br>
                Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck,<br>
                And yet methinks I have astronomy,<br>
                But not to tell of good, or evil luck,<br>
                Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality,<br>
                Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell;<br>
                Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,<br>
                Or say with princes if it shall go well<br>
                By oft predict that I in heaven find.<br>
                But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,<br>
                And constant stars in them I read such art<br>
                As truth and beauty shall together thrive<br>
                If from thy self, to store thou wouldst convert: <br>
                Or else of thee this I prognosticate,<br>
                Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date.<br>
